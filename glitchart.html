<p>The tools utilized to make this project were Adobe Photoshop, Audacity and TextEdit.
<br>This series provides some insight into the misogny as well as lack of POC representation
<br>in the Twitch community and platform. Included are glitched images of two very
<br>well-known female streamers, as well as the Twitch logo itself. In this process, I
<br>used data blending and data moshing, which are methods that utilize TextEdit and Audacity
<br>to change the code or soundwave from the original images to make a glitch effect on these images.</p>
